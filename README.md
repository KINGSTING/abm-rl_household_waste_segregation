Abstract
The persistent challenge of low household compliance with solid waste segregation mandates, as stipulated by the Philippine Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (RA 9003), undermines the effectiveness of municipal solid waste management (MSWM). Local Government Units (LGUs) employ a mix of incentive and punitive policies, but their design often lacks a data-driven understanding of heterogeneous household behavior and long-term efficacy. This study proposes the development of an integrated Agent-Based Model (ABM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to identify the optimal policy mix for maximizing segregation compliance in a Philippine LGU. The ABM will simulate household decision-making by incorporating constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior (Attitude, Subjective Norms, Perceived Behavioral Control), socio-demographic factors (income, education), and the economic utility of LGU policies (fines and incentives). The model will be parameterized and calibrated using empirical data from a household survey in a Northern Mindanao LGU. An RL algorithm will then be deployed to allow the LGU agent to autonomously discover the most cost-effective policy strategy—whether pure incentive, pure penalty, or a hybrid. The expected outcome is a validated computational tool and a set of data-driven recommendations on the optimal fine-to-incentive ratio, providing LGUs with an evidence-based method for policy design that improves compliance while optimizing the use of public funds.
